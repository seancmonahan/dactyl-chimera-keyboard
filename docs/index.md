## Dactyl Chimera build guide

This build guide is a work in progress. It is written for the Dactyl Chimera EX branch. It does not apply to any existing release.

### Designing your keyboard layout
This section was last updated on 2021-10-17.
The first thing to do is come up with a "layout", or keymap, for your keyboard. For example, where do you want to put the enter key? Deciding on a layout will you determine if Dactyl Chimera is right for you, and help you choose which parts to print out.

(insert the section from the build guide here.)
